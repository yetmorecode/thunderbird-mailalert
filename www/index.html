        <li>For the Thunderbird 9 version the preference <i>mail.biff.show_tray_icon</i> must also be disabled. 
            This can be performed in the "Tools > Options > Advanced > View Configuration" dialog by setting the preference to false.
        </li>
    </ul>
     
    <h2><a name="usage">Usage & Screenshots</a></h2>
    
    <h3>Notification window</h3>
    
    <p>
        The notification window is shown every time a new mail arrives. New mails are kept
        in the notification window until they get acknowledged (or Thunderbird is restarted).
    </p>
    
    <p>
        There are three buttons on the top right of the window:
        <ul>
            <li>Show preferences.</li>
            <li>Close window and acknowledge new mail.</li>
            <li>Close window without acknowledging. </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Acknowledging new mails removes the indicator from the system tray and clears the list of 
        mails shown in the notification window.
        
        It also marks all new mails as not new but unread (as in <a href="img/new_unread.png">new vs. unread</a>)
    </p>

    <h3>Settings</h3>
    
    <p>You can find the settings on the top right of each notification window and in the main menu
    under "Tools > Add-ons > Extensions > MailAlert > Settings"</p>
    
    <img src="img/settings_general.png" />
    <img src="img/settings_blacklist.png" />
    
    <h2><a name="localization">Localization</a></h2>
    
    <p>
        I tried my best to offer a english locale (en_US) for the settings dialog ;) There might be strings out there that
        are not localized at the moment.
    </p>
    
    <h2><a name="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h2>
    
    <p>
        The extension includes a binary XPCOM component (NotificationIconService.dll) to integrate to notification
        icon into the windows taskbar.
        Thus the extension only works on
        windows systems. It was compiled using Visual Studio C++ 2010 Express on a Windows 7.
    </p>
     
    <h2 name="problems"><a name="problems">Problems of the standard implementation</a></h2>
    
    Below is a list of problems with the default implementation that made me build
    this extension. Feel free to contact me if you think any of those points is not
    valid.
    
    <h3>No blacklist for folders</h3>
    <p>
        The standard notification system does not provide a blacklist for mail folders.
        Thus many mails from low priority folders are shown what makes it harder to
        actually spot important mails.
    </p>
        
    <h3>No configurable number of new messages</h3>
    <p>
        It is not possible to configure how much new messages should be shown.
        At most five messages are shown at each time. Thus if you received more than
        five mails since last watching mails, you won't see all of them in the 
        notification window.
    </p>
    
    <h3>No proper sorting among new messages</h3>
    <p>
        Messages in the standard notification window are not shown in cronological order.
        If i understood the implementation correct, it just shows mails from <b>one</b> single
        folder that has new mail (more or less randomly).
